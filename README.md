## Experiment 06
<p>Write a Java program to demonstrate the implementation of a decorator pattern for a web page, which might display complex behavior, such as only allowing access to authorized users, or splitting search results across multiple pages</p>

# N.B.
- I still have problems in understanding decorator pattern. I may add the class diagram later when I totally understand this pattern.
